     'End': "walking fast, faces pass and I'm home bound"}

#2 - Print the entire dictionary
print(d)

#3 - Print the type of your dictionary
print((type(d)))

#4 - Print only the keys
print('hero_name')
print('hero_age')

#4 - print only the values
print(d.get('hero_name'))
print(d.get('hero_age'))
print(d.get('Start'))
print(d.get('Middle'))
